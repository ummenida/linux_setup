## Introduction to Linux

## What is Linux?
*Linux* is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel first created by *Linus Torvalds* in 1991.
It is widely used in servers, mobile devices, embedded systems, and desktop computers.

### Key Features of Linux:
- *Free and Open Source*
- *Multitasking* and *Multiuser*
-*Secure and Stable*
- *Highly Customizable*
*Used in Servers, Supercomputers, IoT, Mobile (Android)*

### Open Source Concept
*Open Source Software (OSS)* is software with publicly available source code, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and enhance it.
*Key Principles :*
-*Freedom to Use* : No restrictions on usage.
-*Freedom to study*: Access to source code.
-*Freedom to Modify*: Change the code to suit your needs.
-*Freedom to Share*: Distribute your versions.
Linux is licensed under the *GNU General Public License (GPL)* , which ensures these freedoms.

"Linux is only free if your time has no value." - Jamie Zawinski
> Linux powers 90%+ of the world's supercomputers, most web servers, cloud infrastructure, and is a favorite among developers and security professionals.
